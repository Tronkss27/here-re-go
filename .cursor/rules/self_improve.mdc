description: Guidelines for continuously improving Cursor rules based on emerging code patterns and best practices.

- **Rule Improvement Triggers:**
  - New code patterns not covered by existing rules
  - Repeated similar implementations across files
  - Common error patterns that could be prevented
  - New libraries or tools being used consistently
  - Emerging best practices in the codebase

- **Analysis Process:**
  - Compare new code with existing rules
  - Identify patterns that should be standardized
  - Look for references to external documentation
  - Check for consistent error handling patterns
  - Monitor test patterns and coverage

- **Rule Updates:**
  - **Add New Rules When:**
    - A new technology/pattern is used in 3+ files
    - Common bugs could be prevented by a rule
    - Code reviews repeatedly mention the same feedback
    - New security or performance patterns emerge

  - **Modify Existing Rules When:**
    - Better examples exist in the codebase
    - Additional edge cases are discovered
    - Related rules have been updated
    - Implementation details have changed

- **Example Pattern Recognition:**
  ```typescript
  // If you see repeated patterns like:
  const data = await prisma.user.findMany({
    select: { id: true, email: true },
    where: { status: 'ACTIVE' }
  });
  
  // Consider adding to [prisma.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/prisma.mdc):
  // - Standard select fields
  // - Common where conditions
  // - Performance optimization patterns
  ```

- **Rule Quality Checks:**
  - Rules should be actionable and specific
  - Examples should come from actual code
  - References should be up to date
  - Patterns should be consistently enforced

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Monitor code review comments
  - Track common development questions
  - Update rules after major refactors
  - Add links to relevant documentation
  - Cross-reference related rules

- **Rule Deprecation:**
  - Mark outdated patterns as deprecated
  - Remove rules that no longer apply
  - Update references to deprecated rules
  - Document migration paths for old patterns

- **Documentation Updates:**
  - Keep examples synchronized with code
  - Update references to external docs
  - Maintain links between related rules
  - Document breaking changes
Follow [cursor_rules.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/cursor_rules.mdc) for proper rule formatting and structure.

## Task Master Rule Improvements

When implementing features or fixing issues, consider creating or updating Task Master workflows:

- **Task-Driven Development Patterns:**
  - Create tasks for complex implementations before starting coding
  - Use subtasks to track implementation progress  
  - Update task details with implementation notes and learnings
  - Mark tasks complete only after verification and testing

- **Rule Integration with Task Master:**
  - Update [dev_workflow.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/dev_workflow.mdc) when new development patterns emerge
  - Add project-specific commands to [taskmaster.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster.mdc) if needed
  - Document troubleshooting steps in [taskmaster_setup.mdc](mdc:.cursor/rules/taskmaster_setup.mdc)
  - Ensure rules reflect actual task management practices used in project

- **Task Master Knowledge Updates:**
  - Add new command patterns when discovered
  - Update natural language mappings for better agent interaction  
  - Include project-specific PRD templates and examples
  - Document integration points with other development tools
