# Task ID: 19
# Title: Fix Backend Booking System Validation and Controller Mismatch
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Resolve the data format mismatch between frontend booking submissions and backend validation by aligning route validation schemas with controller expectations and ensuring proper booking creation workflow.
# Details:
1. **Analyze Current Data Flow**:
   - Audit frontend BookingForm component to document exact data structure being sent: {venue, fixture, date, timeSlot, customer, partySize, tablePreference, specialRequests}
   - Review backend routes/bookings.js validation schema and controller expectations
   - Identify specific field name mismatches and structural differences

2. **Update Backend Validation Schema**:
   - Modify routes/bookings.js validation middleware to match frontend data structure
   - Ensure field names align: venue → venueId, fixture → fixtureId, customer → customerInfo
   - Update validation rules for nested objects (customer details, table preferences)
   - Add proper data type validation for dates, party size, and special requests

3. **Controller Alignment**:
   - Update booking controller methods to handle the corrected data structure
   - Implement proper data transformation if needed between validation and database storage
   - Ensure booking creation workflow processes all frontend fields correctly
   - Add error handling for malformed booking data

4. **Database Model Verification**:
   - Verify Booking model schema matches the expected data structure
   - Update model fields if necessary to accommodate frontend requirements
   - Ensure proper relationships with Venue, Fixture, and Customer models

5. **API Response Standardization**:
   - Standardize booking creation response format
   - Include proper success/error status codes and messages
   - Return created booking data in format expected by frontend

6. **Integration Testing**:
   - Test complete booking flow from frontend form submission to database storage
   - Verify all booking fields are properly validated and stored
   - Ensure error messages are meaningful and actionable

# Test Strategy:
1. **Unit Testing**:
   - Test validation middleware with various booking data payloads
   - Verify controller methods handle both valid and invalid data correctly
   - Test database model operations with new data structure

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Submit booking forms from frontend and verify backend processing
   - Test with different booking scenarios: match-based vs. generic bookings
   - Verify all booking fields are correctly stored in database

3. **API Testing**:
   - Use Postman/Insomnia to test booking endpoints with frontend data format
   - Verify proper HTTP status codes and response messages
   - Test error scenarios: missing fields, invalid data types, validation failures

4. **End-to-End Testing**:
   - Complete booking flow testing from frontend form to confirmation
   - Verify booking appears correctly in booking management dashboard
   - Test booking retrieval and display functionality

5. **Data Validation Testing**:
   - Test edge cases: special characters in requests, maximum party sizes
   - Verify date/time validation works correctly
   - Test venue capacity and availability checks during booking creation
