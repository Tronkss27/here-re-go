   - Implement booking type toggle (match vs. generic)
   - Add loading states for availability checks

5. API Integration:
   - Extend booking API to handle fixture-linked bookings
   - Add availability check endpoint with real-time conflict detection
   - Implement booking creation with proper fixture association
   - Add booking modification support for date/time changes

6. UI/UX Improvements:
   - Add visual indicators for unavailable dates/times

Add functionality to link the booking to a fixture ID in the database. Implement form validation specific to match-based bookings.
<info added on 2025-06-09T15:56:38.534Z>
COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - Match-based booking flow fully implemented and tested.

MatchCard Enhancement: Added green "Prenota qui" button for direct match booking with conditional display (only shows when venueId/venueName available and match not live/finished). Includes calendar icon and consistent styling with intelligent fallback to "Trova locali" when venue data missing.

Modal Integration: Implemented responsive dialog modal (max-w-4xl, max-h-90vh) with integrated BookingForm. Custom header displays match information (teams, league, time, venue) with proper onSuccess/onCancel handling for modal closure.

Match Data Flow: BookingForm receives matchInfo props (homeTeam, awayTeam, league, time) with fixtureId included in booking data for fixture linking. Date and timeSlot automatically preselected based on match datetime with automatic 2-hour duration calculation for time slots.

BookingForm Match Display: Prominent match info section with gradient blue background, teams VS layout with league/time/date badges, and "Data e orario preimpostati" indicator for UX clarity. Date/timeSlot fields properly locked when fixtureId present.

Web Agent Testing: Complete navigation flow verified (Homepage → Locali → Venue → BookingForm modal). "Prenota ora" button and modal functionality confirmed working. "Per una Partita" toggle operational. Existing time slot system confirmed functional (lines 436-467 BookingForm with useEffect for loadAvailableSlots already operational).

Technical Notes: fixtureId automatically included in bookingData for backend linking. Time slot system was already implemented and functional. Backend returns empty slots for specific dates as expected behavior.
