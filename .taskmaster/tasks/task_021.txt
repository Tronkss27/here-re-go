# Task ID: 21
# Title: Create Event Creation Form with API-Football Integration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a comprehensive form for creating match announcements, integrating local database and API-Football data, with features for event details configuration, validation, preview, and publication.
# Details:
1. Set up a new React component for the event creation form.
2. Integrate with the FixturesService to fetch match data from both local database and API-Football.
3. Implement form fields for:
   - Match selection (dropdown with search, showing both local and API data)
   - Event details (date, time, venue)
   - Pricing configuration (regular price, discounts, promotions)
   - Additional event information (description, rules, etc.)
4. Add form validation using a library like Formik or react-hook-form:
   - Ensure all required fields are filled
   - Validate date and time formats
   - Check for logical consistency (e.g., end time after start time)
5. Implement a live preview section showing how the announcement will appear
6. Create an API endpoint in the backend for saving the event announcement
7. Add error handling and success feedback for form submission
8. Implement responsive design using Tailwind CSS classes
9. Add accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
10. Optimize component performance, especially for the match selection dropdown
11. Implement caching strategy for API-Football data to reduce API calls
12. Add unit tests for form validation and submission logic
13. Create integration tests for the entire form workflow

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test individual form field validations
   - Verify correct handling of API responses
   - Check preview generation logic

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test the entire form submission process
   - Verify correct data flow between frontend and backend
   - Check error handling and success scenarios

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Use a tool like Cypress to simulate user interactions
   - Test the complete workflow from match selection to announcement publication
   - Verify form behavior with both local and API-Football data

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure and optimize load times for the form, especially with large datasets
   - Test caching mechanisms for API data

5. Accessibility Testing:
   - Use tools like axe-core to check WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
   - Perform keyboard navigation tests

6. Cross-browser Testing:
   - Ensure consistent functionality across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge

7. Mobile Responsiveness:
   - Test the form on various device sizes and orientations

8. Error Handling:
   - Simulate various error conditions (API failures, validation errors) and verify proper handling

9. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Conduct sessions with stakeholders to ensure the form meets all requirements
