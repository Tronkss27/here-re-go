# Task ID: 22
# Title: Complete Booking System Integration - Frontend to Backend Connection
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 6, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement and test the complete booking system by connecting the frontend booking form with the real backend booking system, ensuring reservations are saved to the database and accessible from the admin panel.
# Details:
1. Frontend-Backend API Integration:
   - Create comprehensive booking API endpoints in the backend:
     * POST /api/bookings - Create new booking with validation
     * GET /api/bookings - Retrieve bookings with filtering/pagination
     * PUT /api/bookings/:id - Update booking status
     * DELETE /api/bookings/:id - Cancel booking
   - Implement proper error handling and status codes (400, 409 for conflicts, 500)
   - Add request validation middleware for booking data integrity

2. Frontend BookingForm Integration:
   - Connect the enhanced BookingForm component (from Task 16) to real API endpoints
   - Replace mock data/localStorage with actual HTTP requests using fetch/axios
   - Implement proper loading states, success/error feedback
   - Add form validation that matches backend validation rules
   - Handle booking conflicts and capacity limits with user-friendly messages

3. Database Persistence:
   - Ensure booking data is properly saved to MongoDB using existing Booking model (Task 3)
   - Implement proper indexing for efficient queries (venue_id, date, user_id)
   - Add booking status tracking (pending, confirmed, cancelled)
   - Store booking metadata (created_at, updated_at, booking_reference)

4. Admin Panel Integration:
   - Connect BookingAdmin dashboard (from Task 6) to real database
   - Implement real-time booking statistics and filtering
   - Add booking management capabilities (approve, cancel, modify)
   - Ensure admin can view all bookings with proper pagination

5. Data Flow Validation:
   - Implement end-to-end booking flow: form submission → API → database → admin panel
   - Add proper authentication checks for booking operations
   - Implement booking confirmation emails/notifications
   - Add audit logging for booking operations

6. Error Handling & Edge Cases:
   - Handle network failures with retry mechanisms
   - Implement optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
   - Add proper validation for date conflicts and venue capacity
   - Handle concurrent booking attempts with proper locking

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test all booking API endpoints with various input scenarios
   - Verify database operations (create, read, update, delete)
   - Test form validation and error handling
   - Mock API responses to test frontend error states

2. Integration Testing:
   - Test complete booking flow from form submission to database storage
   - Verify booking appears correctly in admin panel after creation
   - Test booking status updates propagate correctly
   - Validate booking conflicts are properly detected and handled

3. End-to-End Testing:
   - Create booking through frontend form and verify in database
   - Test admin panel booking management functionality
   - Verify booking confirmation and cancellation workflows
   - Test concurrent booking scenarios for same venue/time

4. Performance Testing:
   - Test booking system under load (multiple simultaneous bookings)
   - Verify database query performance with large datasets
   - Test API response times under various conditions

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Test complete user journey: browse venues → select date → book → receive confirmation
   - Verify admin can manage bookings effectively
   - Test mobile responsiveness of booking flow
   - Validate accessibility of booking forms and admin interface

6. Data Integrity Testing:
   - Verify all booking data is correctly stored and retrievable
   - Test data consistency across frontend, API, and database
   - Validate booking references and relationships are maintained
   - Test backup and recovery of booking data
