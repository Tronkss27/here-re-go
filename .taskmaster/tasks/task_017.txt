# Task ID: 17
# Title: Client Landing Section in Homepage with User Profile Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2, 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add a personalized client section to the homepage (http://localhost:5173) with direct links to profile, bookings, team preferences, and favorite spots. This section should only be visible to authenticated users with 'client' role.
# Details:
1. Create ClientLandingSection Component:
   - Design a dedicated section component for authenticated clients
   - Implement role-based visibility using AuthContext from Task 2
   - Add conditional rendering based on user.role === 'client'
   - Style with SPOrTS design system (Orange theme, Tailwind CSS)

2. Profile Management Quick Access:
   - Create navigation cards/buttons for:
     * User Profile Management (personal info, avatar, settings)
     * My Bookings (view/manage current and past reservations)
     * Team Preferences (favorite teams, notifications settings)
     * Favorite Spots (saved venues, quick booking access)
   - Implement hover effects and responsive design
   - Add icons for each section using consistent iconography

3. Integration with Existing Systems:
   - Connect with booking system from Task 16 for "My Bookings" link
   - Integrate with user authentication state from Task 2
   - Ensure proper routing to respective management pages
   - Add loading states and error handling

4. Homepage Integration:
   - Modify the main homepage component to include ClientLandingSection
   - Position section prominently for authenticated clients
   - Ensure seamless integration with existing homepage layout
   - Implement smooth transitions and animations

5. User Experience Enhancements:
   - Add personalized greeting with user's name
   - Display quick stats (upcoming bookings count, favorite teams)
   - Implement quick actions (book now, view latest matches)
   - Add notification badges for pending items

# Test Strategy:
1. Authentication Testing:
   - Verify section is hidden for unauthenticated users
   - Test visibility only appears for users with 'client' role
   - Confirm other roles (admin, manager) don't see the section
   - Test behavior during login/logout transitions

2. Navigation Testing:
   - Click each navigation link and verify correct routing
   - Test all quick access buttons lead to appropriate pages
   - Verify deep linking works correctly from external sources
   - Test back navigation maintains proper state

3. Responsive Design Testing:
   - Test layout on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
   - Verify touch interactions work properly on mobile devices
   - Check text readability and button sizing across devices
   - Test hover states and animations on different screen sizes

4. Integration Testing:
   - Verify booking data displays correctly in "My Bookings" preview
   - Test team preferences integration and data persistence
   - Confirm favorite spots data loads and updates properly
   - Test real-time updates when user data changes

5. Performance Testing:
   - Measure component load times and rendering performance
   - Test with various user data loads (many bookings, favorites)
   - Verify no memory leaks during component mounting/unmounting
   - Check API call efficiency and caching behavior
